actively use them in normal life.\

Constitution or Wisdom. Once the saving throw is failed, addiction has set in provided it is past the addiction stretch.\

Addiction levels are cumulative. For each addiction stretch you go without breaking, you gain an additional level of addiction. While in 
withdrawal, you can start the day after a long rest by making a Constitution or Wisdom saving throw. The check is equal to ten times your 
highest level of addiction. If you succeed, you can ignore the effects of the addiction for that day. You can lower your addiction level by 
going through an addiction stretch without partaking in your addicted narcotic.

**Addiction 1**\
Disadvantage on ability checks while in withdrawal.

**Addiction 2**\
Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws while in withdrawal. 

**Addiction 3**\
Your speed is halved and you cannot concentrate while in withdrawal.
